I'm a highly driven and ambitious ex-basketball and baseball player who's passionate about computer programming.

I am seeking a **full-stack junior software developer** role although I'm open to localising to a **back or front-end role** if necessary for the company. I thrive best in an environment which offers **challenging day-to-day work** and a company culture where employees push each other to contribute the best of themselves. I'm not a static person, it's essential to be dynamic and adaptable and so I'd like to undertake work in a setting where progress is encouraged.

## Skills

**Programming**

From my time at Makers Academy and onwards, I have been developing with OOP languages like Ruby and Java. I have also worked with JavaScript and I'm keen to explore more JS frameworks (particularly, React)

As of writing, I'm particularly interested in coding with Node.js, data science and machine learning.


**Modern Foreign Languages**

| Languages | Proficiency |
|-----------|--------------|
| English | Native |
| Spanish | Intermediate |
| Japanese | Novice |


**Mentoring**


In college, I was hand-picked by GCSE teachers to help provide 1-to-1 in-class tutoring with their students.
Through listening to the students' worries and engaging them in a way that inspired them to believe in their intellect, I was able to help them solve their issues.


**Leadership and self-starter**

In university, I was nominated to be captain of the Afro-Caribbean Society Basketball Team. I always made it a priority to motivate and encourage my team to compete to the best of their abilities. My drive and commitment also earned me a place on the Team GB U-19 Baseball Squad.
