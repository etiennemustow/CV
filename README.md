As of writing, I am a graduate of a highly selective, 12-week intensive software development programme at Makers Academy.
Through graduation, I have gained a foundation in adapting my approach to learn new languages, implementing Test and Behaviour-Driven Development, and utilising the Extreme Programming (XP) framework.
<br><br>I am seeking a full-stack junior software developer role in an environment which offers challenging day-to-day work and an environment in which employees care, genuinely, about the progress of their peers.
