As of writing, I am a graduate of a highly selective, 12-week intensive software development programme at Makers Academy.
Through graduation, I have gained a foundation in adapting my approach to learn new languages, implementing Test and Behaviour-Driven Development, and utilising the Extreme Programming (XP) framework.
<br><br>I am seeking a full-stack junior software developer role in an environment which offers challenging day-to-day work and an environment in which employees care, genuinely, about the progress of their peers.

## Skills

#### Emotional Intelligence

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- Healthcare Assistance
- How it's developed over time (initial domiciliary care through to care home to agency to other settings)


#### Problem Solving

Mathematics has long been one of my favourite subjects in school. It's due to this passion, that I have developed a logical and creative approach to solving real-world issues (outside of the world of mental arithmetic).
<br>
In college, I was hand-picked by GCSE teachers to help provide 1-to-1 in-class tutoring with their students, going over any issue the student raised.
Through listening to their worries and engaging them in a way that didn't condescend their intellect, I was able to help them solve their issues. (Always satisfying due to the immediate change in coutenance)
I have further developed my problem solving skills during my time at Makers Academy. Constantly analysing stack traces for different errors of various frameworks has matured my eye for spotting and fixing faults.


#### Leadership

I enjoy being tasked with leading ventures, whether it be accepting a nomination to captain a sports team or being asked to take the reins on a particular part of a technical project.
I have embraced the motto of "Always lead by example", in that I believe a great leader isn't just one that excels when things are going right, but one who knows how to control a situation with sincerity and humility when things go wrong.
<br>
In university, I was nominated to be captain of the Afro-Caribbean Society (ACS) Basketball Team. Of course, we had our wins but in our losses, I always made it a priority to motivate and encourage my team to fight until the end and never dwell on a mistake.


#### Social Media Analysis

Although, I believe social media has its bad sides, I throughly believe that it is a tool which will continue to shape our world and can be utilised for good.
<br>
During university, I was responsible for maintaining social media pages and groups on Facebook for a multitude of student groups. 
Creating engaging posts for the target population came very naturally to me and through creating posts regularly, many of the pages increased in hits dramatically.
